You can use Audacity, foobar2000 or Adobe Audition to convert to ogg.

HOW TO CONVERT WITH FOOBAR2000:

1.	Right click on desired track, then Convert -> Quick Convert
2.	Select "Ogg Vorbis", then press Edit and set Quality to q3.0
3.	Press OK, then Convert
4.	At this step you will be required to specify path to oggenc2, if you haven't done it already.
	Download it from here: http://www.rarewares.org/files/ogg/oggenc2.87-1.3.3-generic.zip
	Put it in some folder and specify path to it when foobar2000 prompts for it.


In Adobe Audition it helps to make markers and name markers that you can export all at once in the end.
In Audacity you can attach marker to current selection by pressing Ctrl-B.
