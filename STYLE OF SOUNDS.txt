Chatsounds has a certain type of humor that I try to enforce. The best way to explain this is just to listen to the examples in "chatsounds/style/*"

If you don't agree you probably shouldn't add any sounds.

rule of thumb:

	BAD:
		sounds that are designed to be funny
		memes
		MLP
		high pitched anime
		voices from lets players on youtube

	GOOD:
		bad voice acting
		voice sounds from games
		sounds that try to be funny but are so unfunny that they become funny
		sounds that aren't funny at all but has the potential to become funny when used together with other chatsounds
		

Sounds from games are especially good because they were made for a specific context. When taken out of its context the sound doesn't make sense and thus becomes a tool to assemble your own context by using it in combination with other sounds.
